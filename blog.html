    <h4>The Difference Between 'While' and 'Do While' loops</h4>
      <p>
        The difference between 'while' and 'do while' loops is that in a 'do while'
        loop the code always executes once before the condition is checked. In a
        while loop, the condition is checked before the code executes.
      <h4>java.util.Scanner;</h4>
        <p>
          When you import java.util.Scanner; into your code you are importing
          a library and function that allows a user to enter input into the
          program.
        </p>
      <h4>'void' method declaration</h4>
        <p>
          The 'void' method declaration is for functions that do not return
          a data type. If a function has a value to return then it must be
          declared. If it does not, then it must be declared void.
        </p>
      <h4>Experience Coding</h4>
        <p>
          I have some experience coding using c++ because I went to CU Denver
          for three semesters. I got as far as learning arrays and vectors and
          some knowledge of classes and structs. I have created programs that can
          write to and import from files and created a matrix using vectors as a
          first step toward writing a program that is a game of battleship.
        </p>
      <h4>Pitfalls</h4>
        <p>
          Some of my greatest pitfalls I can attribute to my learning disability,
          ADHD. When it comes to learning new skills it can be both a blessing and
          a curse. It allows me to hyperfocus and work on projects for an extended
          period of time and be very productive with few breaks. However, it also
          makes it difficult to stay focused on learning new skills if I have long
          breaks between the instruction and putting it into practice. For that reason,
          I believe Skill Distillery will be an appropriate learning environment for
          me, because I won't be given any time to forget or lose interest!
